**About Me**

I am a dedicated software developer with a strong passion for building high-quality, intuitive applications that address real-world challenges. My core focus is Android development using Jetpack Compose, where I specialize in creating responsive UIs and integrating complex features seamlessly. I also have experience in Laravel, Firebase, Supabase, and developing real-time systems.

**What I’m Currently Exploring**

I am currently deepening my understanding of optimizing real-time systems, improving the performance and scalability of mobile apps, and enhancing user experience through better UI/UX practices in Jetpack Compose.

**Featured Projects**

* **GreenStep** – A carbon emission tracker that leverages AI and Firebase to help users monitor and reduce their environmental footprint.
* **UrbanGo** – A real-time public transport delay tracker built with Supabase and geolocation features.
* **ResQR** – An emergency response app allowing first responders to access users’ medical data via QR codes displayed on lock screens, with SOS voice command support.
* **SquibleSquad** – A dynamic note-taking app with rich UI interactions, color-coded notes, and real-time updates.
* **Retrofit Music App** – A sleek music streaming app powered by Retrofit, supporting album art, track previews, and responsive design.
* **EchoSphere** – An AR-based Android app allowing users to drop and discover floating audio messages in physical locations using ARCore, Supabase, and GPS.

**Open to Collaborations**

I’m always excited to work with others on Android, AI, and real-time systems. If you have an idea or a challenge, I’d love to connect and collaborate on building something impactful.
